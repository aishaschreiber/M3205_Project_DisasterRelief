Steps to run model:
1. Ensure you have downloaded the files/folders: 'BendersLazy.py', 'CLFDIP Model Data Generation Tool' folder, access_data_edit.py
2. Ensure the working directory is the same as the 'CLFDIP Model Data Generation Tool' folder
3. 'BendersLazy.py' operates with a Verbose, thus setting Verbose = TRUE will ensure the output is printed. To run the model, just run 'BendersLazy.py'. 
4. To run the MIP formulation, use 'Simple_Layout.py'


##### CLFDIP Model Data Generation Tool is the folder that contains all the instances (provided by the Authors)
##### More Generate Instances is the folder that contains instances generated by us
