Steps to run mini model:
1. Download the folder MINI_RUN.zip which contains all the files neccesary to run a few provided instances.
2. Open MAIN_BENDERS.py to run the Benders Loop


Steps to run model:
1. Ensure you have downloaded the Three files/folders: 'MAIN_BENERS.py', 'CLFDIP Model Data Generation Tool' folder, and 'access_data_edit.py'
2. Ensure the working directory is the same as the 'CLFDIP Model Data Generation Tool' folder
3. 'MAIN_BENDERS.py' operates with a Verbose, thus setting Verbose = TRUE will ensure the output is printed. To run the model, just run 'MAIN_BENDERS.py'. 
4. To run the MIP formulation, use 'MIP_LAYOUT.py'


- CLFDIP Model Data Generation Tool is the folder that contains all the instances (provided by the Authors)
- More Generate Instances is the folder that contains instances generated by us
- STORAGE is a foler that contains our multiple previous attempts at getting the Benders Loop to run.
- INSIGHTS is a folder that contains code that compares the run time of the MIP formulation and the Benders Loop.
