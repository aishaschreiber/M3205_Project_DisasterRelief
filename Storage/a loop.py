##Really Strange Points
#1. We have used for s in S when generating the data Md_s..., this causes an issue because the s will be passed to ReducedCSP
# which might not be the same s used in CSP
# (Im thinking write a function to generate the Md_s, TFs_sm)

#2. KeyError: (1, 2759.0), where does 2759.0 come from!! at line 195
#Probably caused by 1
